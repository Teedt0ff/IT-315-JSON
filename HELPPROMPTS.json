   "We Love Raves": "The developers over at FFF Love raves. This app is designed with a rave function where if you shake the phone enough, it'll change to random colors.",
   "purpose_and_design": "This app was designed so that you could have a less intense forward-facing flashlight for when your rear flashlight is too intense for its use case.",
   "brightness_control_tip": "Did you know there's a way to turn your brightness down lower than what the bar allows you to do on the control panel? Go to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size and then enable the Reduced White Point option. This will make it so that your phone doesn't blind you when you're using it at night."
